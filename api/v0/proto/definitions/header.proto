/*
A Header contains routing and state data on a configuration file.

Both ApiVersion and Kind are used by the router to find the correct handler. Increment
is used as a protection against replay attacks. This means that for all configuration files, each has
an increment exactly 1 greater than the last.

example:

 header: {
    ApiVersion: "v0Alpha",  // a versioned API
    Kind: "WalletSet",      // WalletSets might be found in multiple ApiVersions as well
    Increment: 14,          // in total 13 other configuration files have been processed before this one.
    }
*/
message Header {
    string ApiVersion = 1 [(validate.rules).string = {
                                min_len: 2, // ApiVersion must contain two characters, e.g. v0.
                          pattern: "^v", // ApiVersions must start with character v
                          }];
    string Kind = 2 [(validate.rules).string.min_len = 1]; // Kind must be set, which means a min_len of 1.
    int32 Increment = 3 [(validate.rules).int32.gt = 0];
